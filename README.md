# Classification and Regression 4

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ICL-BMB-BiDS/BIDS10-ClassificationRegression4/blob/main/BIDS_10_ClassificationRegression_4.ipynb/)


This session is dedicated to an introduction of (artificial) neural networks and discusses a basic network architecture for classification, the (multilayer) Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), and an unsupervised network, the AutoEncoder (AE), which can be used in a classification setting.

For feature importance, you can use tools we used in other BIDS tutorials, or another package called shap, install via:
```
conda install -c conda-forge shap # alternatively do pip install shap
```
